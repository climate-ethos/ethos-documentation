# Ethos Project

## Overview

This site hosts the documentation for the heat early warning system developed by the [Ethos Project](https://www.griffith.edu.au/research/climate-action/climate-transitions/health/ethos-project) at [Griffith University](https://www.griffith.edu.au/) with funding provided by the [Wellcome Trust](https://wellcome.org/) (grant 224709/Z/21/Z: 'Individualised heat-health early warning systems: A novel digital solution', held by S. Rutherford, A. J. E. Bach, S. Binnewies).

The Ethos Project aims to provide a heat Early Warning System (EWS) for vulnerable populations, such as older people. It achieves this through real-time monitoring of ambient conditions (ambient temperature and relative humidity) using sensors placed around a user's place of residence. These sensors then transmit that information to a base station which then processes and displays that data as well as forwarding it to the server.
